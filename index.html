        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>I'm a B.E. candidate in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering
            (2023) with a CGPA of 7.73. I have technical proficiency in Core Java,
            SQL, HTML, and DBMS, showcased through projects like a beetle bot and
            an Automatic Doorbell with face detection using Arduino. As a senior
            executive member, I actively contributed to the Electronics And
            Telecommunication Student Association (ETSA) and participated in
            technical teams like Adhyaaya</p>

        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>Passed out from Government College Of Engineering,Nagpur in Electronics and Telecommunication with 7.73 CGPA.</p>

        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <ol>
            <h2><li>Automatic Door bell with face detection - aurdino ,
                Mini Project</li></h2>
                <h4>May 2022 - July 2022</h4>
                <p>
                    Engineered an innovative automatic doorbell system using Arduino,
    integrating object detection capabilities with infrared sensors, and
    wrote robust code that efficiently discriminated between animate
    and inanimate objects, reducing false alerts by 90%
                </p>
            <h2><li>Beetle Bot - Robotics , Final Year Project</li></h2>
            <h4>February 2023 - June 2023</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The objective of this project was to create a remotely
                    controlled beetle bot using a PS2 controller, an Arduino Uno
                    microcontroller board, and a motor driver. Specifically, the
                    objectives of the project were as follows:</li>
                <li> To design and build a basic robot using a chassis, motors, and
                    beetle leg wheels that can be controlled remotely using a PS2
                    controller</li>
                <li>To design a beetle bot that can walk on rough terrains using a beetle leg mechanism</li>
                <li>To program the Arduino Uno microcontroller board to
                    interpret the signals from the PS2 controller and control the motors of the robot accordingly</li>
                    <li>To implement a motor driver to control the speed and
                        direction of the motors</li>
            </ul>
            </ol>
